This is a draft of a book I've been writing to more fully explain the
reasoning behind why modularity in software architecture is valuable. As
with most books, this project is a lengthy exercise and really the draft
is too early to publish. But the web makes it _so easy_ to publish
stuff, it can't hurt.

If you would like to comment on anything you find here, please don't
hesitate to email me at [malcolm@juxt.pro](mailto:malcolm@juxt.pro), or better still, join the
modularity google group and post there.
