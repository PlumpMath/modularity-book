# Cylon

Cylon is a collection of components that play a role in the security of
a Clojure system built upon the ideas described in this book.

Cylon provides both an educational example of how to construct libraries
of components that offer a greater degree of interchangeability and a
production-ready solution to the real-world challenge of reliably
securing a modular software system.
